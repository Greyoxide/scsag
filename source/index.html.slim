    h2 This is 80 years
    p Hi we're Sheri Lynn Woolcock and Curt Coffman.  Together, we have more than 80 years of experience serving the local timber industry.  We started South Coast Saw and Garden in 1981, and we've enjoyed every minute of it.  Sure, there've been difficult points, but our greatest joy comes from our close friendship with our customers.

    p We've seen our customer's children grow up and become customers themselves.  Looking back now, we fondly remember all of our customers.  We've been with you through the good times and the bad.  Like you, we've tied our entire future to the local timber industry.  We were there when the spotted owl dealt us a blow.  We were there when the 2008 market crash hit us.  We've been with you every step of the way.

    p Here, you can find a supplier who takes you seriously.  One who knows what its like to brave the odds.  We know you need your gear and equipment to hold out.  That's why we carry gear and equipment which has been tested against the harshest conditions.  If there's even the slightest doubt, we wont carry it.  We stand behind our reputation.
